#The files above were downloaded and processed from the SILVA 138 release data using the RESCRIPt plugin and q2-feature-classifier. Sequences were downloaded, reverse-transcribed, and filtered to remove sequences based on length, presence of ambiguous nucleotides and/or homopolymer. Taxonomy was parsed to generate even 7-level rank taxonomic labels, including species labels. Sequences and taxonomies were dereplicated using RESCRIPt. Sequences and taxonomies representing the 515F/806R region of the 16S SSU rRNA gene were extracted with q2-feature-classifier, followed by dereplication with RESCRIPt.
